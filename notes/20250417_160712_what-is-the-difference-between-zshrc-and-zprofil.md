# Difference Between .zshrc and .zprofile

Both .zshrc and .zprofile are configuration files for the Z shell (zsh), but they serve different purposes and are loaded at different times:

## .zprofile
- Loaded once when you login (for login shells)
- Similar to .bash_profile in bash
- Ideal for setting environment variables, paths, and other settings that should be set once per login
- Runs before .zshrc
- Good place for commands that should happen once per session (like PATH modifications)

## .zshrc
- Loaded for each new interactive shell (every time you open a terminal)
- Similar to .bashrc in bash
- Used for shell options, aliases, functions, and custom prompt settings
- Runs for every new terminal window or tab
- Good place for interactive configurations that should apply to each shell session

In practice, many users put most of their configurations in .zshrc and use .zprofile sparingly, if at all. If you want settings to be available in all shell instances but only want them to be set once, put them in .zprofile. If you want settings to be reapplied every time you open a new terminal, put them in .zshrc.
